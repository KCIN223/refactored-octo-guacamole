<p>Graphics Project is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the field of architecture organized by Yoonjai Choi.
    We examine various methods of visual communication used to convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the Graphics Project Webpage.
    Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting. details on day 2 presentations here.
